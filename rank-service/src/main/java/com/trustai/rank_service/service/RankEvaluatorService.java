     *     <li>Prevents rank downgrade: if the user already holds a higher rank, it is retained.</li>
     *     <li>If no rank qualifies, falls back to the lowest rank (e.g., RANK_0).</li>

     * <p>This method is designed to provide a **preview** of the highest rank a user can qualify for
     * without making any changes to their current rank. It is useful for:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Admin dashboards and reporting tools that show what rank a user would earn if evaluated today.</li>
     *     <li>Explaining rank eligibility to users (e.g., “You're missing X criteria to become Silver”).</li>
     *     <li>Debugging and testing the rank evaluation logic with full visibility into rule failures or passes.</li>
     * </ul>

     * <ul>
     *     <li>Evaluates all active ranks in descending order of priority.</li>
     *     <li>Collects detailed results of all specification checks per rank.</li>
     *     <li>Applies downgrade protection logic — prevents a lower rank from being selected if the user already holds a higher one.</li>

     * @return EvaluationReport containing the matched rank (if any), spec results, and downgrade flag
